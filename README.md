# San Diego County Kindergarten Vaccination Rates Analysis
by Joe Yerardi

*inewsource* conducted an analysis of data from the [California Department of Education](http://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/filessp.asp) and the [California Department of Public Health](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/immunize/pages/immunizationlevels.aspx) to determine vaccination rates at kindergartens in San Diego County for the 2016-17 school year.

The analysis found that the proportion of San Diego County kindergartners fully up-to-date on their vaccinations reached its highest point in more than a decade and that the gaps between wealthier and poorer schools vanished in the wake of a 2015 law severely curtailing the ability of parents to acquire personal belief exemptions for their children.

These results formed the basis for the April 28, 2017 story "[Kindergartner vaccinations rising in San Diego County after state law change](https://wp.me/p6tuYl-6kJ)."

The analysis script is in a Jupyter notebook (kindergarten_vaccinations.ipynb). The files used in the notebook can be found in  this repository's data folder. Original versions of the files can be found at the links above.
